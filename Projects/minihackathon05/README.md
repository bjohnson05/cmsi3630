# Mini-Hackathon Number 5 &ndash; Alien Invasion Game
## Learning Outcomes and Project Description

The purpose of this assignment is to broaden your understanding of data structures and algorithms by using them to create the game _ALIEN_INVASION_.  In the Alien Invasion project, you’ll use the Pygame package to develop a 2D game. The goal of the game is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. At the end of the project, you’ll have learned skills that will enable you to develop your own 2D games in Pygame.

## Specification

In this game project, you’ll set up Pygame and then create a rocket ship that moves right and left and fires bullets in response to player input.  After that, you’ll create a fleet of aliens to destroy, and then continue to refine the game by setting limits on the number of ships you can use and adding a scoreboard.

## Program Focus

While building this game, you’ll also learn how to manage large projects that span multiple files. We’ll refactor a lot of code and manage file contents to organize the project and make the code efficient.  Alien Invasion spans a number of different files, so you should make a new alien_invasion folder on your system.  Be sure to save all files for the project to this folder so your import statements will work correctly.  Also, you should be sure to use a GitHib repository for this project. If you haven’t used GitHub before, check out the video recording about it on BrightSpace.

## Usage

The program <code>AlienInvasion</code> is intended to be run via the following command-line invocation:
<pre>
     $ python AlienInvasion
</pre>

## Historical Note

This game is very much like the ancient video game "Space Invaders" which dates back to the late 1970's.  Space Invaders was an arcade video game designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, and released in 1978.  It was originally manufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and was later licensed for production in the United States by the Midway division of Bally.  Space Invaders is one of the earliest shooting games and features two-dimensional graphics.  The aim is to defeat waves of aliens with a laser cannon and earn as many points as possible.

# Compilation Notes

Your program must run from the command line or terminal using the syntax given above.

Do not submit any IDE specific files.  If your program does not run using the command mentioned above you will receive no credit.

# Additional Development Notes

Please remember that when implementing this project you may be using elements of it in subsequent assignments or in other classes in your career.  In particular, you could be using the foundations for parity generation and checking using this scheme in a distributed fashion!

# Good Luck!!
