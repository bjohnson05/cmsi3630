# Mini-Hackathon Number 5 &ndash; Alien Invasion Game
## Learning Outcomes and Project Description

The purpose of this assignment is to broaden your understanding of data structures and algorithms by using them to create the game _ALIEN_INVASION_.  In the Alien Invasion project, you’ll use the Pygame package to develop a 2D game. The goal of the game is to shoot down a fleet of aliens as they drop down the screen, in levels that increase in speed and difficulty. At the end of the project, you’ll have learned skills that will enable you to develop your own 2D games in Pygame.
