Homework01 Evaluation
======================
For homework01, the focus is to make sure that your GitHub repository is set
up and that your Java environment is installed and working properly.  The
actual programming for the first part of the assignment is trivial, just a
simple program to display "Hello World!" on the terminal window which was
done in class anyhow..

Since this is also the in-class assignment for week01, you should have the
code in at least one or the other of the two places, either classwork01 or
homework01 [or both].  I will locate it and make sure it appears in both
locations if it is only in one at no cost.

The second part of this is to make sure you have the directory structure
[folder hierarchy] set up in your repo.  If this is not correctly done, I
will fix it for you of course.

Finally, part two of the homework is the first 'real' algorithm we looked at
as described in class, the 'piSolver.py' program to estimate the value of
PI using a Monte Carlo Simulation approach.

scores:
=============================
Structure for classwork complete    2 out of 2 pts.
Structure for homework complete     2 out of 2 pts.
'sayHi.py' program committed        4 out of 4 pts.
'sayHi.py' program compiles/runs    4 out of 4 pts.
'piSolver.py' program committed     4 out of 4 pts.
'piSolver.py' program compiles/runs 4 out of 4 pts.

Total possible score: 20 out of 20 for 100%

Your score: 20 out of 20 which is 100% which is an A-plus
