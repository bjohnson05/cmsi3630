Homework02 Evaluation
======================
For the HighArray.py source file, be sure to use good coding practices to
make your code pretty, artful, and maintainable.

First, translate the code from the LaFore textbook from Java into Python.
I have given you starting code for that in my GitHub repository.  Make sure
that you have the basic file working before you proceed, so that if there
are errors you know where they are coming from.

You must add a "getMax()" method to the HighArray.py file, which returns
the largest "key" [another word for "value"] in the array.  You must also
add a "noDups()" method which will find and remove any duplicated values.
For example, in the array that contains "33 33 33 44 44 55 55 66" the
result of colling "noDups()" should be "33 44 55 66".  Be sure to research
the way python handles lists ~ it will make your life easier!

For the HighArrayApp.py file DO NOT include this code in the same source
file as "HighArray.py".  You must have TWO SEPARATE FILES for this, both
in the same directory, so that you can 'import' the 'HighArray.py' file as
a 'module' into the 'HighArrayApp.py' program.

Submit both your source code files to your repo.  THERE MUST BE TWO PYTHON
SOURCE FILES IN YOUR REPO FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT TO GET FULL CREDIT.

I have mentioned in class that it is a good idea to have a small "header"
section in your files.  If you elect to include that in this assignment,
you will get two extra credit points.  You can use either the "#" tags or
the 'triple tic' comment method for block comments, your choice.  Headers
are extra credit for THIS assignment, but will be REQUIRED for all future
assignments.

There are a total of 20 points for this assignment as shown below.  If you
get extra credit it is possible to get more than 100% for the assignment.

Total possible score: 20 out of 20 which is 100% which is an A-plus

Your score: 20 out of 20 which is 100% which is an A-plus
   headers: 22 out of 20 which is 110% which is also an A-plus

Comments:



Nice work!

You should take the time to check the output of your program to verify that
everything is working as it *should*.  If you look carefully through the
output, you'll notice that when displaying the contents of the list, nothing
is displayed.  That is because the "display()" method that was provided
simply returns, without doing anything.  Something to consider: even if the
problem specification doesn't ask for it, it's a good idea to add in code so
that the user can actually see what is supposed to be happening!  No harm no
foul this time, but something to be aware of for the future!
