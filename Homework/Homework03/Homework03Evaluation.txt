Homework03 Evaluation
======================
For Queue.py you should have a single ended Queue class with all the methods
we have discussed in class, including inserting, deleting, and displaying.
You should also have a 'QueueApp.py' source file that imports your 'Queue.py'
class and tests out all of the methods in it.

For Deque.py, you should again have two files, a 'Deque.py' file which has
all the functionality and a 'DequeApp.py' file to test it.  See the rubric
below to see what methods are required.

The circular linked list is a special case of the Python 'list' which allows
you to have an 'endless' or 'beginning-less' list of entries.  Because of
the way Python handles lists, you won't need to make it 'linked', but you
WILL need it to be 'circular'.  You will also make that into a 'stack' that
is 'LIFO' in nature for the next problem.

Finally, there will be an 'extra credit' problem if you want some extra
challenge ~ implement a python version of the 'Josephus problem' as it is
described on the homework web page for a possible 5 extra points!

Total points is 35 for Queue, Deque, and Circular x2
 extra credit is 5 points for Josephus problem
-------------------
 Grand total is 40 points

You got 35 out of 35 which is 100.0% which is an A-plus
