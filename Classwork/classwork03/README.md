# In-class Assignment #3

Your mission [should you decide to accept it], is to implement the <code>insertValueAtIndex()</code> method.  Do you need to worry about whether there is enough room in the list?  What happens if you insert a duplicate value to something already in the list? 

Next, also add a method <code>checkIndex()</code> to validate an index value, and re-factor your code.  Refactoring means to re-do your code to take into account some new "thing" you have decided to add or change.

Also, add a new method <code>prepend()</code>, which adds a value at element zero of the list, moving all the other 
values to make room. 

If you have time, make yourself an exception class, give it the name <code>EmptyListException</code>, and add it 
into your code.  Be sure you set this up so that your exception is thrown appropriately! 

Be sure to check everything into your Git repo in the classwork03 folder when you are done.
