# In-class Assignment #3

Your mission [should you decide to accept it], is to implement the <code>insertValueAtIndex()</code> method, making 
sure that if there isn't enough room in the list already, its size gets expanded by the amount of the 
<code>STARTING_SIZE</code> value. 

Then, also add a method <code>checkIndex()</code> to validate an index value, and re-factor your code. 

Also, add a new method <code>prepend()</code>, which adds a value at element zero of the list, moving all the other 
values to make room. 

If you have time, make yourself an exception class, give it the name <code>EmptyListException</code>, and add it 
into your code.  Be sure you set this up so that your exception is thrown appropriately! 

Be sure to check everything into your Git repo in the classwork03 folder when you are done.
