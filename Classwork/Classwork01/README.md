# In-class Assignment #1

This assignment is to make sure you have your environment working, so you are ready for the rest of the semester. 
It is perfectly OK to ask your classmates for assistance if you get stuck and I am busy helping someone else. 
You will need to do the following to produce your first program for this session:

1. Install the Java Development Kit on your computer if you haven't already done so
1. Install a text editor or IDE on your computer if you haven't already done so
1. Create a bookmark in your favorite browser to the Java API pages if you haven't already done so; the link for Java 10 is here
1. Create a file called "SayHello.java" in a directory of your choosing by whatever method you are comfortable with
1. Edit the file and create a program that will simply print "Hello, World!" to the console using System.out.println().
1. Compile and run your program to make sure everything works.
1. Add to your program to prompt the user to input their name from the console using the Scanner class. Don't forget you will need to import from java.util.Scanner at the top of your source file. You can then use the following two lines in your file to create a scanner object and read the user's input:

           Scanner myInput = new Scanner( System.in );
           String inputName = myInput.nextLine();
                            

1. Add more lines to your program to change the "Hello, World!" message to say "Hello, " followed by the name that the user has input.
1. Compile and run your program to make sure everything works.
1. Test your program with several different inputs, like dog, $237.19, and just pressing Enter without entering anything. See if you can break your program!
1. Go to GitHub and set up your repo and submission structure if you haven't already done so.
1. Upload and commit your completed SayHello.java file to your repo
1. Pat yourself on the back for a job well done! [Just don't hurt yourselfâ€¦]
