# In-class Assignment #1

This assignment is to make sure you have your environment working, so you are ready for the rest of the semester. 
It is perfectly OK to ask your classmates for assistance if you get stuck and I am busy helping someone else. 
You will need to do the following to produce your first program for this session:

1. Install Python on your computer if you haven't already done so
1. Install a text editor or IDE on your computer if you haven't already done so
1. Create a file called "sayHello.py" in a directory of your choosing by whatever method you are comfortable with
1. Edit the file and create a program that will simply print "Hello, World!" to the console using the <code>print()</code> function.
1. Run your program to make sure everything works; you can use the terminal/command line or run from IDLE.
1. <strong>Add to your program</strong> to prompt the user to input their name from the console using python's <code>input()</code> function. 
1. Add more lines to your program to change the "Hello, World!" message to say "Hello, " followed by the name that the user has input.
1. Run your program to make sure everything works.
1. Test your program with several different inputs, like 'dog', '$237.19', and just pressing 'Enter' without entering anything. See if you can break your program!
1. Go to GitHub and set up your repo and submission structure if you haven't already done so.
1. Upload and commit your completed SayHello.java file to your repo
1. Pat yourself on the back for a job well done! [Just don't hurt yourselfâ€¦]
